# Sentence-Autocompletion-using-FineTuned-DistilGPT2
Fine-tunes DistilGPT2 for sentence autocompletion. Includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and decoding (greedy, top-k, top-p) for generating fluent sentence completions. Lightweight, efficient, and ready for deployment.

Key highlights:

Dataset Preparation: Custom preparation of input sequences for autocompletion tasks.

Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning DistilGPT2 on domain-specific or task-specific data to improve sentence prediction quality.

Training and Evaluation: Full training loop with loss monitoring, validation, and model checkpointing.

Decoding Strategies: Implementation of decoding methods like greedy search, top-k sampling, and nucleus (top-p) sampling for better autocompletion performance.

Deployment Ready: Fine-tuned model saved and ready for integration into applications like smart keyboards, email assistants, or writing tools.

This repository provides a practical foundation for anyone interested in building efficient, real-world text generation systems.
